# README

The University of Brasilia has many extension programs and student groups/teams that focus on competitions, varying from the robotics area to the formula SAE area. Each team may have students from many courses and semesters, who participates in several projects for the team they are in. To make it easier to know who participated in which project and what was developed by that student/project, a database was designed, also as final project for the DataBase class, seeking out to avoid rework and losing valuable knowledge created in these trajectories. This repo manages the construction of said database.

The main code was developed using Python and MySQL, the inner constructions of the database can be found in files written in PT-BR.
